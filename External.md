# Port Forwarding

Port forwarding allows for external users that are trying to access your website to be forwarded through a designated port to your machine.

This [Website](http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/) should help you with setting up port forwarding.  Check out the generic guide for your router type for general instructions.

# DNS

If you don't have a static IP or don't want to pay for a domain name, I would suggest using [DuckDNS](http://www.duckdns.org) as your provider.  DuckDNS includes platform specific instructions for setting it up.

This would allow users to type in a *www* address instead of an IP address.
